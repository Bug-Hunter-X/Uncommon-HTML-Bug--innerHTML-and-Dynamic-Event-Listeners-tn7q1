    This text is initially visible.

  <script>
    // Simulate an uncommon bug:  Incorrect use of innerHTML that leads to unexpected behavior
    // with dynamically added content and event listeners
    const myDiv = document.getElementById('myDiv');
    const newContent = '<button onclick="alert("+1+")">Click Me</button>';

    myDiv.innerHTML = newContent; // Bug: Overwrites previous content and doesn't correctly handle event listeners in dynamically added HTML

    //The expected alert is 2 instead of 1. Event listeners are not properly attached
    //when innerHTML is used to replace existing content.
